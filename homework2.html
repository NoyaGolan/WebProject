         <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 225, 255)"><i><ins>Early Life</ins></i></h3>
         <p>Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is African-American Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee who worked as a drummer, <br>
             performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. <br>
            His mother, Sandra "Sandi" Graham (née Sher), is a Canadian, from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, who worked as an English teacher and florist. <br>
            Graham performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he met Sandra, who was in attendance. <br>
            Drake is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada, the former derived from Graham. <br>
            In his youth, he attended a Jewish day school, and became a bar mitzvah. <br>
            <br> Drake was raised in two neighbourhoods. He lived on Weston Road in Toronto's working-class west end until grade six and attended <br>
            Weston Memorial Junior Public School until grade four, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. <br>
            Drake was a promising right winger, reaching the Upper Canada College hockey camp, but left at the behest of his mother following a vicious cross-check to his neck during a game by an opposing player. <br>
            He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000.[37][38] When asked about the move, Drake replied, "[We had] a half of a house we could live in. <br>
            The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford." <br>
            Demonstrating an affinity for the arts, at age 10, Drake appeared in a comedic sketch which aired during the 1997 NHL Awards, featuring a riff <br>
            of Martin Brodeur and Ron Hextall and their record as being the only goalies to have scored multiple goals. <br>
            <br> He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute for high school,[41] and then attended Vaughan Road Academy in Toronto's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood; Drake <br>
            described Vaughan Road Academy as "not by any means the easiest school to go to." <br>
            Drake was often bullied at school for his racial and religious background,[42] and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his <br>
            burgeoning acting career, he dropped out of school.[43] Drake later graduated in October 2012. </p>

        <p><b>Influences</b> <br>
            Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West,[334] Jay-Z,[335] MF Doom,[336] and Lil Wayne, <br>
            while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah[338] and Usher. <br>
           Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his "biggest inspirations". <br></p>

       <p><b>Musical style</b> <br>
        Drake is considered to be a pop rap artist. While Drake's earlier music primarily spanned hip hop and R&B, his music has delved into pop and trap in recent[when?] years. <br>
        Additionally, his music has drawn influence from regional scenes, including Jamaican dancehall[341] and UK drill. <br>
        Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. <br>
        His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism.</p>
   
        <p>His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries <br>
            which include such phrases as "ting", "touching road", "talkin' boasy" and "gwanin' wassy".[345] Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip hop elements, <br>
            and he combines rapping with singing.[346] He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. <br>
            His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, <br>
            and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.[347] Drake's style of R&B is characterized <br>
            by vacant beats and a rap-sung dichotomy, which has also seen incredible mainstream success, spawing several imitators.</p>

        <p>The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional[349] or boastful. <br>
            However, Drake is often revered for incorporating "degrading" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, <br>
            often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. <br>
            His songs often maintain tension between "pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata." <br>
            Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as "hyper-reality rap", characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as distinct from the "real world."[</p>
